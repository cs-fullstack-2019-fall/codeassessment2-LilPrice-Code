# ### Problem 6
# Create a class called ClubMember 
# Each club member has a name and a role  
# Create ClubMember instances for the following people:
# ```
# Alfred - Club President
# Troy - Club Vice President
# Albert - Club Secretary
# Bob - Club Treasurer
# ```
# Add each member instance to a new club_members list that you create.
# Write the code needed to loop through the club member list and print the current number of members in the list, then the memberâ€™s name and club role, one per line using f strings.

# Example Output:
# ```
# There are currently 4 club members in the list!

# Club President: Alfred
# Club Vice President: Troy
# Club Secretary: Albert
# Club Treasurer: Bob
# ```

# Creating class
class ClubMember:
    def __init__(self, name, role):
        self.name = name
        self.role = role

# Creating list and members
club_member = []
c1 = ClubMember("Jack", 'President')
c2 = ClubMember("Jesse", "Vice President")
c3 = ClubMember("Matte", "Treasurer")
c4 = ClubMember("John", "Secretary")
# Adding members to the list
club_member.append(c1)
club_member.append(c2)
club_member.append(c3)
club_member.append(c4)
# How member in the list
num = len(club_member)
# Printing the list
print(f'There are currently {num} club members in the list!')
for x in club_member:
     print(f"Club {x.role}: {x.name}")
